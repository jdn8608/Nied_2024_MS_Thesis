# Thesis Title: Evaluating the Capabilities of Supervised Machine Learning Techniques for Operational Over-Ocean Cloud Masking with Satelitte Imagers  
## Description:  
This repository contains the code and data for my thesis on the application of machine learning techniques to enhance cloud detection in satellite imagery. The focus is on evaluating various supervised machine learning models, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Dense Neural Networks (DNNs), & Random Forests (RFs), for semantic segmentation and cloud masking.  

We aim to compare performative enhancements of CNNs that utilize texture over spectral-only ML models. Furthermore, we focus on the aspects and neccessary requirements to use these methods globally and operationally.
